# Audiation
Open-source music player built with Electron. Currently work-in-progress, but somewhat useable.

## How to run
In order to run Audiation, you must have the Node.js framework installed.

Once installed, continue below.

1. Etiher download a zip copy of this repo or clone it.
2. Navigate to the directory where Audiation's files are stored and run `npm install`.
3. Once all the dependencies have finished installing, run `npm start`.

## Audiation folder
In order to play songs, you must add your songs in the Audiation folder. This should be stored in your home directory's music folder.
Once I add support for multiple sources, I will remove the Audiation folder requirement.
